For the second in-class assessment, you should
be familiar with the syntax and ideas behind
the following:

- understand the difference between integers, doubles,
characters, dates, and date-times
- understand the naming conventions for variables in this class
- know how to properly space around the `<-` sign
- know how to construct a full data schema
- know how to extract a variable from a data frame
- know how to produce a simple plot of a variable
- know how to convert a variable to character variable with `as.character`
- know how, and understand what is going on, to convert a numeric variable to a character variable with `cut`

Remember, the assessment includes fill in the blank questions, not
just multiple choice, so make sure you remember the specific
function commands.
