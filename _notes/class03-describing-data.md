### Data Dictionary

It is important to understand and document exactly what each
variable in a dataset is describing. A description of all the
variables in a dataset is called a **data dictionary**. Often
these seem self-explanatory, but it is still useful to briefly
describe all of the variables. Here is an example of a data
dictionary for the Arburthnot dataset:

- **head_of_state**: who was the Head of State for the country
representing London
- **year**: calendar year of the dataset
- **boys**: number of male baptised in London in a given year
- **girls**: number of female baptised in London in a given year
- **total**: total number of children baptised in London in a given year
- **boy_to_girl_ratio**: ratio of male births to female births
in London in a given year

Notice that you probably guess the basic meaning of many of these,
but may not have been aware of some of the specifics.
