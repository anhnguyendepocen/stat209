you get to play in everyone's backyard."

### Statistics in 209

This course is truly about the holistic process of **doing**
statistics. There will be very little mathematical content. For that,
you'll need the MATH329 (Probability) and MATH330 (Statistics)
sequence.

**So, come into this course with an open mind about
what we will be covering. I believe you will find it interesting,
fun, and incredibly useful.**
