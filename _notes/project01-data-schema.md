**Due**: 2018-01-13 (start of class)

**Starter code**: [project01.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsmaths/stat209/master/projects/project01.Rmd)

**Rubric**: [rubic_project01.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsmaths/stat209/master/projects/rubic_project01.pdf)

The overarching goal of the first project is to collect a
data set, produce a data schema, and provide a basic
exploration of the variables from your data.

The first step is to decide what data set you would like to
collect. Your data set should follow these rules:

- at least 75 observations
- at least 5 variables, with:
    - at least 2 numeric variables (time counts as a numeric variable)
    - at least one character variable of categories
    - at least one variable that you physically collect yourself
- be uploaded to GitHub as a csv file along with your report

This is a chance to do something creative. Here are just a
few suggestions:

- pick a favorite magazine and collect data about the ads:
what pages are they on; what's the product; how many words are
there; how many people are in the ad (ect).
- sit on a bench somewhere during a busy time of day and count
how many people walk in two minute intervals in each direction
past you; create a categorical flag for whether someone asks
what you're doing
- make a dataset with one observation for various family and
friends; record the last date you saw each person; give each
person a score from 1 to 10 for how much you like them
- watch TV for a few hours and collect data about the ads:
product in question; time of the ad; length of the add (ect.)
- make a desperate plea on social media for data (hopefully you
have more than 75 friends); append a column for how well you
know each person

You're not restricted to these ideas. In fact, I encourage you
to find other interesting things to discover. For details on
the format of the report and how it will be graded, please see
the rubric and starter code.
